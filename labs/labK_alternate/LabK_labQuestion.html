    <h2>Question</h2>
    Write a Verilog program to implement and test a subtractor. The
    program should have three modules. The first module, called
    cfulladder implements a one bit subtractor with two 1-bit outputs, S
    and Cout, and three one bit inputs A, B, Cin. You have to use always
    keyword to implement this combinational circuit. The second module,
    called sub4 implements a four bit subtractor by instantiating 4
    cfulladder modules. It has the same inputs and outputs but now the
    S, A, and B are four bits wide, while the rest are still one bit.
    <p> The last module, called t_sub is a testbench. It instantiates
      one sub4 module and tests it for several possible inputs. Using
      the pre-lab as guide you define A and B as 4-bit registers and
      initialize them to zero. Then, using a repeat loop you increment A
      and B by 1 and 2 respectively and display the time, A, B, S and
      Cout, in this order as decimals. You repeat the loop 7 times. You
      have to have a 5 unit delay before every display instruction. All
      modules should be in one file. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>Coding Style</h2>
    <p> Style is important in programming, so it is expected that you
      have proper indentation, comments, short and meaningful
      identifiers, and all things that define good style. Every file in
      your program has to have a header identifying the author, course
      and a short description, every module in every file has to have a
      short header with the name and a short description of the module.
      Keep your comments and descriptions short. You should follow the
      conventions of Verilog, like indentation, etc. The modules for
      this Lab are small so one to three comments per module is a good
      guide.<br>
