    <h1>Computer Organization: LabL02</h1>
    <h2>Question</h2>
    <p> Write a Verilog program to implement and test a 4 bit ALU. You
      will write at least two modules. The first is called ALU4 and has
      two 4-bit data inputs, A and B. One control 3-bit input ctl, which
      takes the values 000, 001, 010, 100 and 111, for ADD, AND, OR, SUB
      and SLT (set less than) respectively. It has one 4-bit output Z.
      You will probably need a 4 to 1 MUX like the one in the prelab and
      an arithmetic unit like the yArith in the prelab. Note that the
      first (MSB) of the control input is equal to 1 only for SUB and
      SLT. You have to use the parameter facility of Verilog. </p>
    <p> The last module, called t_ALU is a testbench. It instantiates
      one ALU4 module and tests it for several possible inputs. Using
      the pre-lab as guide you define A and B as 4-bit registers and
      initialize them to dollar-random. Then, using a repeat loop
      display time, A, B, and Z, in this order. You repeat the loop 10
      times for each possible value of the control input and display the
      value you expect like the prelab. You have to have a 5 unit delay
      before every display instruction. All modules can be in one file
      if you want. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>Coding Style</h2>
    <p> Style is important in programming, so it is expected that you
      have proper indentation, comments, short and meaningful
      identifiers, and all things that define good style. Every file in
      your program has to have a header identifying the author, course
      and a short description, every module in every file has to have a
      short header with the name, short description of the module. Keep
      your comments and descriptions short. You should follow the
      conventions of Verilog, like indentation, etc. The modules for
      this Lab are small so one to three comments per module is a good
      guide. </p>
